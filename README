This is a almost 1:1 copy of the PHP wrapper provided by Context.IO. All I did is translate the ugly PHP syntax into Java syntax...

Some methods aren't implemented (downloadfile) and others don't work exactly as the PHP version.

This project uses almighty scribe-java library by Fernando and powerful gson library by Google. Thanks for these two pieces of awesome sauce! :)
